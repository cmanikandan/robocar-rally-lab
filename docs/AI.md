# AI - Getting started

The ML tutorial is run as a series of [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) on [AWS Sagemaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

If you instead want to run the tutorial on you own computer, most of the code should work just fine if you've set up the development environment properly. See
the [Donkey library](http://docs.donkeycar.com/) documentation.

Without further ado, you'll find the first notebook [here](../ml/donkey-intro.ipynb).

# Machine Learning categories

[comment]: <> ( description of ways in which you can let machines or algorithms loose on a data set )

### Supervised

[comment]: <> ( You know how the output/labels should look like )
[comment]: <> ( Predicting labels from examples/features )

### Unsupervised

[comment]: <> ( You don't know the structure of the data sets )
[comment]: <> ( Outcomes to most of the problems are largely unknown )

### Reinforcement

[comment]: <> ( Agents, Algorithms, Environment, State and Reward )
[comment]: <> ( monitor the response of the actions, and measure against a reward )

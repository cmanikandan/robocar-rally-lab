# Deep learning
###### Crash course

---

### Why ML?

Too complicated to program

---

### AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

---

### CNNs + behavioral cloning

---

### Supervised learning

- data (x)
- model (f)
- loss function
- an algorithm to tweak the model params so that the loss function is minimized

---

### Supervised learning

labels + examples -> learning algorithm -> model
(training labels) + (training inputs)  -> ... -> model

inputs + model -> outputs
